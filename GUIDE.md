### Error handling

Unreadable directories are not listed or backed up. An error is shown for
each unreadable directory unless it is not excluded.

Unreadable files are listed but since they cannot be backed up, an error is shown
during backup operations for these files.

For restore operations, an error will be shown for each
file that was included but cannot be written.
